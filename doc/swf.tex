\section{Numerical Solution}

\subsection{Newton-Raphson Method}

Flow throughout the connected channel network is based on a Newton-Raphson formulation, in which the following equation is formulated and solved simultaneously for each reach

\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:nr-cvfd}
\begin{split}
\left ( \sum\limits_{m \in \eta_{n}} \frac{\partial Q_{n,m}}{\partial h_n} + \frac{\partial Q_{n,s}}{\partial h_n} - \frac{\partial Q_{STO}}{\partial h_n} \right ) h^k_n + 
\sum\limits_{m \in \eta_{n}} \frac{\partial Q_{n,m}}{\partial h_m} h^k_{m} = \\
- \left ( \sum\limits_{m \in \eta_{n}} Q_{n,m} + Q_{n,s} - Q_{STO} \right ) + \\
\left ( \sum\limits_{m \in \eta_{n}} \frac{\partial Q_{n,m}}{\partial h_n} + \frac{\partial Q_{n,s}}{\partial h_n} - \frac{\partial Q_{STO}}{\partial h_n} \right ) h^{k-1}_n + \sum\limits_{m \in \eta_{n}} \frac{\partial Q_{n,m}}{\partial h_m} h^{k-1}_{m}.
\end{split}
\end{equation}


\subsection{Discretized Flow Expression}

Manning's equation is written as

\begin{equation}
  Q = \frac{1}{n} A R^{2 \over 3} \sqrt{S_f}
\end{equation}

\noindent For the numerical implementation in MODFLOW we express Manning's equation as a product of a conductance term and the product of the head difference between reach $n$ and $m$

\begin{equation}
  Q_{nm} = C_{nm} \left ( h_m - h_n \right )
\end{equation}

\noindent The average conductance between the two cells $C_{nm}$ is calculated using the following harmonic mean, which consists the half-cell conductance in reach $n$ and the half-cell conductance in reach $m$

\begin{equation}
  C_{nm} = \frac{C_n  C_m}{C_n + C_m}
\end{equation}

The half-cell conductance for reach $n$ is calculated as

\begin{equation}
  C_n = \frac{B_n}{ L_{nm} \sqrt{ \frac{ | \left ( h_m - h_n \right ) | } {L_{nm} + L_{mn}}} }
\end{equation}

\noindent where $B_n$ is the conveyance for reach $n$.  Conveyance is calculated in several different ways depending on how the cross section is defined.  In the simplest case, the conveyance is calculated as

\begin{equation}
  B_n = \frac{A_n R_n^{2 \over 3}}{n}
\end{equation}
