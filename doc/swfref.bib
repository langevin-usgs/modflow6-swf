  abstract = {A physically-based, spatially-distributed model is presented for simulation of surface/subsurface flow and the interactions between these domains. The model is designed for practical application to a wide variety of hydrologic evaluations, at various scales of simulation. The system is represented by the three-dimensional saturated–unsaturated flow equation for the subsurface, coupled with the diffusion wave equation for areal overland flow, both of which are coupled with the diffusion wave equation for flow through a network of streams and channels, including hydraulic structures. Ground surface unevenness at the grid scale is incorporated via the concept of detention storage, and thick vegetation or urban features are included via an obstruction storage exclusion term. Evapotranspiration from the surface and subsurface are modeled using land cover and climatic factors to define the complete water budget using a physically-based formulation. The system of equations is discretized using a fully implicit procedure, with the Newton–Raphson method to handle non-linearities efficiently. Robustness, stability and accuracy of solution are obtained for a wide variety of cases including dry systems and large surface/subsurface interaction fluxes. Adaptive time-stepping schemes and under-relaxation formulas further alleviate the computational burden. Verification and application examples demonstrate the need for a rigorous, fully-coupled solution to the set of equations, for complete hydrologic-cycle analysis.}

  abstract = {This paper proposes the control volume finite element (CVFE) method, a locally conservative formulation of the better known finite elements (FE) approach, to deal more effectively with overland flow. The two-dimensional overland flow problem is introduced and several approaches available in the literature are briefly reported. The partial differential equations describing overland and channel processes are then presented and a consistent two-dimensional formulation for the head losses is introduced. The derivation of the CVFE discrete formulation is preceded by a discussion on the classical integrated finite difference (IFD) and FE approaches, together with their advantages and disadvantages. The CVFE formulation is shown to improve on both approaches, resulting in a better representation of the gradients than that of the IFD approach and, in contrast to the FE, allows for the conservation of mass at local scale. The preliminary results obtained with a CVFE computer code are presented and compared with analytical solutions. Finally, several computational aspects are discussed, such as the formulation of the time integration, the representation of the water volumes pertaining to each node of the space discretization mesh and the explicit imposition of the local mass balance.}

  abstract = {Abstract In this paper, we present a flexible approach for simulating one- and two-dimensional routing of surface water using a numerical surface water routing (SWR) code implicitly coupled to the groundwater-flow process in MODFLOW. Surface water routing in SWR can be simulated using a diffusive-wave approximation of the Saint-Venant equations and/or a simplified level-pool approach. SWR can account for surface water flow controlled by backwater conditions caused by small water-surface gradients or surface water control structures. A number of typical surface water control structures, such as culverts, weirs, and gates, can be represented, and it is possible to implement operational rules to manage surface water stages and streamflow. The nonlinear system of surface water flow equations formulated in SWR is solved by using Newton methods and direct or iterative solvers. SWR was tested by simulating the (1) Lal axisymmetric overland flow, (2) V-catchment, and (3) modified Pinder-Sauer problems. Simulated results for these problems compare well with other published results and indicate that SWR provides accurate results for surface water-only and coupled surface water/groundwater problems. Results for an application of SWR and MODFLOW to the Snapper Creek area of Miami-Dade County, Florida, USA are also presented and demonstrate the value of coupled surface water and groundwater simulation in managed, low-relief coastal settings.},
